<br><b>Description:<b>
  <br>
  <br>The job role is focused on the user experience for primarily arcade style games,
  <br>I believe this role would involve a lot of work with GUI’s and wire frame work.
  <br>I feel this could be an exciting way to apply the skills I will be learning over the next few years.
<br>
<br><b>Skills:<b>
  <br>
  <br>The skills required for this role are CSS, HTML5 & React very much front-end skill which I do not currently have.
  <br>Working in teams will require good communication skills, negotiation, respect for each other’s ideas and skills,
  <br>self-leadership and a degree of autonomy.
  <br>This particular job is remote so time management and establishing communication channels will also be key
  <br>factors in addition to the technical requirements.
<br>
  <br>At present, I do not have the technical qualifications required as even GIThub is new to me.
  <br>I do poses the ability to communicate, manage my time and workload and work autonomously which I have
  <br>gained from working in the hospitality industry and can be transferrable to this role.
<br>
  <br>I plan on completing my IT degree with RMIT to kickstart my career and get a foot in the door with a programming company.
  <br>I would like to work as a back end or front end developer and as my experience & knowledge base grow,
  <br>work my way into the position of full stack.
  <br>To achieve this, I will need to learn multiple computer languages & program development skills.
