    <br>Yes Chef!
    <br>An Application for The Hospitality Industry
</div>

<div class="overview">
  <p>
    <br><b>Overview:</b>
    <br>
    <br>I intend to create application that will have a business component (food costing, recipes, daily invoicing and wage control) and a
    <br>social aspect which will allow chefs engage with each other and share ideas.
    <br>The app will take input from the user in the form of goods, operating percentages, profits & expenses to allow a day-to-day
    <br>feedback on where the business sits both financially and stock wise.
    <br>The application will also delve into rostering, ordering and very importantly learning / teaching.
    <br>Yes Chef! will be the go-to application for the Hospitality industry.
</div>

<div class="motivation">
  <p><b>Motivation:</b>
    <br>
    <br>As of June 2016, there were a little over 85,000 eating out establishments in Australia with only 34% of these
    <br>belonging to the Fast food industry, yet there is a  complete lack of an application that tackles the behind the
    <br>scenes of kitchen operation. I have encountered these challenges in my previous roles s Head Chef and have
    <br>created workaround spreadsheets using Microsoft Excel and processes which lead me to conclude that is a gap in
    <br>the market which this app may fill.
    <br>This app will not only save a busy chef time but will also streamline processes for the payroll and
    <br>accounts department. As a retired chef moving into the IT profession, it is my goal to create this
    <br>application and join my two passions passing on knowledge to new generations of Chefs.
</div>

<div class="description">
  <p><b>Description:</b>
    <br>
    <br>The completed application will consist of many different elements that chefs deal with on a regular basis.
  </div>

<div class="destab">
  <p>
    <br><b>Dish Costing:</b>
    <br>A page that will let the chef add ingredients, ingredients cost, & the percentage that the
    <br>business expects to make from food sales. This will then output the sale price for the chef and
    <br>create a printable clean recipe card for the rest of the team to follow.

  <p>
    <br><b>Invoice Control:</b>
    <br>A page that would have drop down menus for each supplier, item & amount as well as a
    <br>search bar for quick referencing. The page would store every item that the kitchen buys much
    <br>like a spreadsheet, this list can be added to during invoice entry, dish costing or from a
    <br>shopping list with the potential to have APIs for suppliers to directly submit invoice information
    <br>saving the chef time.

    <p>
      <br><b>Cost Monitoring by the item:</b>
      <br>In this area, I will show every purchased item throughout a selected period that
      <br>has had a price increase or decrease, each change will be highlighted to the day so that the
      <br>Chef can pinpoint when a supplier has changed a price and address the issue if necessary.

    <p>
      <br><b>Ordering:</b>
      <br>Here the Chef can create an order list or shopping list. Each item can be designated
      <br>to a preferred supplier, the Chef can then phone, email or app order knowing that the items are
      <br>being sent to the correct supplier, API’s can once again be used to directly order from suppliers
      <br>that have an online system.

    <p>
      <br><b>Rostering:</b>
      <br>Rostering will let the chef create and cost a working roster it will have drag and drop features
      <br>as shifts in the industry change regularly. The roster will also be able to be sent directly to all
      <br>team members.

    <p>
      <br><b>The recipe book:</b>
      <br>This is a both online & on device area where the Chef can store & share recipes, the
      <br>share side being optional as some recipes are considered “top secret”. Upon importing a recipe
      <br>new items can be added to the shopping list and suggest a local supplier for this ingredient.
      <br>This section will offer the user the ability to customize their preferred supplier.

    <p>
      <br><b>The Group:</b>
      <br>A small social media section which will offer capacity to add industry-based contacts and
      <br>different information shared, for example recipes or supplier contacts. This would also have
      <br>the potential to be expanded to include job advertising and searching within a specified area.

    <p>
      <br><b>Learning:</b>
      <br>A help station for new users to familiarize and use the application & informal mentoring and
      <br>support for both employees who are new to leadership roles in the kitchen and those already in leadership positions.

    <p>
      <br><b>Welcome Page:</b>
      <br>This is the landing page which will contain notifications and links to all items within the app.

    <p>
      <br><b>Running Tally:</b>
      <br>This will be the master sheet, a daily, weekly, monthly & yearly running tally of all cost and
      <br>expenditure, the user will be able to see wages, food cost and revenue all together and break
      <br>down each item as they need to see it.
</div>

<div class="description">
  <br>All these pages will be available in both an online (Web) format and mobile app format.
</div>

<div class="toolstech">
  <p>
    <br><b>Tools & Technologies:</b>
    <br>
    <br>Programming and application development tools such as Python & Xamarin will be essential for development,
    <br>although at this stage, I am unsure exactly which software I will use. Test hardware in the form of an iPad,
    <br>iPhone, Android device & computer (low end spec) to make sure anyone can run the software. And finally,
    <br>a finished product can shipped preinstalled and set up on a device selected by the client. This would obviously
    <br>incur an additional cost or contract on the device.
</div>

<div class="skills">
  <p>
    <br><b>Skills Required:</b>
    <br>
    <br>Programming & Design, are the 2 key skills that will be needed for this application.  The user interface will need
    <br>to be simple to use, easy to navigate and quick in transitions between pages or sections. Communication will
    <br>also be a major factor as concepts move between the two industries (Hospitality & IT). I am currently studying
    <br>programming as well as IT and plan on shaping my degree to obtain as many skills as I can in Web
    <br>development & Application development.
</div>

<div class="outcome">
  <p>
    <br><b>Outcome:</b>
    <br>
    <br>Upon successful completion of the application, I would have a fully functional Hospitality application that can
    <br>serve not only Chefs and kitchen staff but also other areas like Bars and housekeeping.
    <br>The application which is targeted at the Hospitality industry is a result of my passion for what I have done
    <br>over the last 20 years. It will be an information repository for future chefs and a learning tool for those
    <br>who are new to management roles within the Hospitality industry and a financial tool for managing a kitchen budget.
    <br>This application will be the bridge between Hospitality & Information Technology
