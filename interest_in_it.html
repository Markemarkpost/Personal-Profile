  <b>Interest in IT:</b>
  <br>
  <br>During high school, I was introduced to using computers for minor tasks in class.
  <br>I remember being interested in using MS Paint to determine its functionality.
  <br>I was also interested in playing small basic games on the computers.
  <br>The early interest that I had in IT was continually fed by my high school IT teacher,
  <br>Mr Wilks who would engage in conversation for hours about technology, computers and software programs
  <br>both during class, break time and outside of school time.

  <br>My passion for IT escalated throughout the 90’s, as I was exposed to using PC’s for
  <br>gaming and other media editing and creating tasks.
  <br>I was in awe of local studios like Westwood for their production of intricate PC games
  <br>like Dune 2000 & Command and Conquer, which were hard to comprehend that they were the product of a
  <br>few people using a PC rather than hundreds of people behind the scenes.

  <br>
  <br>Into the 2000’s, I moved to Australia and my main hobby was now tinkering with computers,
  <br>trying to run high end games and saving pennies to buy the next piece of hardware to upgrade.
  <br>By this stage I had also had a good understanding of operating systems like Windows, MSDOS and some Linux software.
  <br>In 2020, I opened my own small business to provide people in my local area with an affordable basic tech
  <br>support and servicing which has a significant waiting time at the local computer businesses.
  <br>This brings us to today, I have chosen RMIT as the next building block in my career in IT.
  <br>The university has a fantastic reputation and offers a learning structure that fits my lifestyle and
  <br>learning needs as a remote student.
  I hope RMIT will take me out of my comfort zone and open new avenues for me within the IT world.
  <br>I am aware that for the most part, I have always worked on computer hardware and not delved too far into
  <br>much of anything else.
  <br>I expect that through my studies, I will become familiar with the software applications,
  <br>programming and information security as we as concepts that I  not yet thought about.
