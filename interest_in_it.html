<b>Interest in IT:<b>
<br>
<br>During high school, I was introduced to using computers for minor tasks in class.
<br>I remember being interested in using MS Paint to determine its functionality.
<br>I was also interested in playing small basic games on the computers.
<br>The early interest that I had in IT was continually fed by my high school IT teacher,
<br>Mr Wilks who would engage in conversation for hours about technology, computers and software programs
<br>both during class, break time and outside of school time.
<br>
<br>My passion for IT escalated throughout the 90’s, as I was exposed to using PC’s for
<br>gaming and other media editing and creating tasks.
<br>I was in awe of local studios like Westwood for their production of intricate PC games
<br>like Dune 2000 & Command and Conquer, which were hard to comprehend that they were the product of a
<br>few people using a PC rather than hundreds of people behind the scenes.
<br>
<br>Into the 2000’s, I moved to Australia and my main hobby was now tinkering with computers,
<br>trying to run high end games and saving pennies to buy the next piece of hardware to upgrade.
<br>By this stage I had also had a good understanding of operating systems like Windows, MSDOS and some Linux software.
<br>In 2020, I opened my own small business to provide people in my local area with an affordable basic tech
<br>support and servicing which has a significant waiting time at the local computer businesses.
<br>This brings us to today, I have chosen RMIT as the next building block in my career in IT.
<br>The university has a fantastic reputation and offers a learning structure that fits my lifestyle and
<br>learning needs as a remote student.
I hope RMIT will take me out of my comfort zone and open new avenues for me within the IT world.
<br>I am aware that for the most part, I have always worked on computer hardware and not delved too far into
<br>much of anything else.
<br>I expect that through my studies, I will become familiar with the software applications,
<br>programming and information security as we as concepts that I  not yet thought about.
