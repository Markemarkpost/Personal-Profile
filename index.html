          <h4>About Me:</h4>
I was born in Gloucester England & raised in a working-class family in the Cotswolds, growing up in a village was a wonderful experience of quaint English life. During my Primary & secondary school years my focus was usually on Football as is often the case with British children, I was very lucky as my father would regularly take me to Old Trafford to watch Manchester United, I have very fond memories of these times.
Toward the end of my time at high school I worked as a Kitchen Hand at the local Hotel (Calcot Manor) where after a short time I would fall in love with the notion of becoming a chef and my career in Hospitality would begin.
I studied as a full-time apprentice to achieve my NVQ levels 2 & 3, this was very much a hands-on learning experience as an assessor would come out to the Hotel once a month to see what I had covered & how I was progressing. It was during my time as an apprentice that I met my first Australians one of whom I would later marry bringing me to this amazing country.
My first few years in Australia were all based in Hospitality however it was during this time that I really took an interest in IT, Specifically the hardware end of computers. My brother-in-law and I would work together figuring out what hardware we needed and bettering each otherâ€™s work and ideas.
