<div class="about_me">
  <h4>About Me:</h4>
  <br>I was born in Gloucester, England.  I was raised in a working-class family in a village in the Cotswolds.
  <br>My childhood was the stereotypical British childhood, obsessed with football,
  <br>living in a village where everyone knew everyone and very much reflective of quaint English life.
  <br>Football was a big part of my younger life, it was an activity which I shared with my father,
  <br>brother and other men in our village.
  <br>My Father and I would often go to Old Trafford to watch Manchester United play, and the aftergame drinks and conversations.
  <br>I have very fond memories of these times.
  <br>
  <br>In my senior years of high school, I had a part time job as a kitchen hand at the local hotel (Calcot Manor).
  <br>Working in a busy exclusive kitchen and exposure to the talent and skill of the Chefs, created my love for food and
  <br>the notion of becoming a chef and thus my career in Hospitality began.
  <br>
  <br>I worked and studied as a full-time apprentice to achieve my NVQ levels 2 & 3.
  <br>There was a small aspect of theory and written work but the majority of my training was focused on hands-on learning.
  <br>The course assessor visited on a monthly basis to evaluate my progress and development.
  <br>During my apprenticeship, I met my first Australian, whom I would later marry and emigrate to this amazing country for.
  <br>
  <br>My first few years living in Australia were all based in Hospitality; however, it was during this time that I developed an interest in IT.
  <br>My interest lay specifically the hardware end of computers.
  <br>My brother-in-law and I would work together, figuring out what hardware we needed to build gaming PCâ€™s and then evaluated how to do it better.
